One of the first react app I did. Couldn't finish because had problem connection with node back end. Hopefully I will find the power to continue

The app is recognize the face from a link. I did it a year ago and I wasnt able to connect to the back end that is why I hang on the register and sign in page

Used React, ParticleJs and clarifai for the recognition job
